## 👨‍💻 LeetCode Portfolio  

Welcome to my **personal LeetCode practice repository** 📚  
This is where I train my brain 🧠, improve my coding skills, and slowly become a better problem solver every day.

Each problem in this repository includes:

✅ **solution.py** → My first working solution (even if it's not perfect)  
✅ **reference.py** → A cleaner or optimized version  
✅ **README.md** → My notes, mistakes, logic, and what I learned  

---

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This  

I created this repository to:

🚀 Build strong **problem-solving habits**  
🧩 Recognize common **DSA patterns**  
💼 Prepare for **technical interviews**  
📈 Track my growth as a developer  

Over time, this will become my **personal coding knowledge base** that I can revisit and improve.

## 🗂 How It's Organized  

Problems are grouped by difficulty level:

📂 **easy/** → Beginner friendly problems  
📂 **medium/** → Logic + optimization challenges  
📂 **hard/** → Advanced algorithm problems  

Each problem has its **own folder** with:

- Problem files  
- Solution code  
- Explanation notes  

This keeps everything clean and easy to navigate ✅

## 🌟 My Goal  

My goal is NOT just to solve problems...

🔥 I want to **understand the logic deeply**  
✍️ Write **better code every time**  
📊 Track my **daily progress and improvement**  
🧠 Become confident with algorithms and data structures  

This repository represents my **learning journey** — not perfection, but consistent growth 🚀
