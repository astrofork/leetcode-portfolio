# LeetCode Portfolio

This repository is my personal space to practice problem-solving and get better at writing clean, efficient code.

Every problem here includes:
- `solution.py` → My first working solution (even if it's not perfect)
- `reference.py` → A cleaner or more optimized version
- `README.md` → My notes, mistakes, and what I learned from the problem

## Why I'm Doing This
I'm using this repo to build strong problem-solving habits, recognize common patterns, and prepare for technical interviews.  
Over time, this will also serve as my personal reference for approaches I can reuse and improve.

## How It's Organized
Problems are grouped by difficulty:
- `easy/`
- `medium/`
- `hard/`

Each problem has its own folder named:


## My Goal
The goal is not just to solve problems, but to understand them deeply, write better code each time, and track my growth as a developer.
